# Goathouse Bottle Spinner Prompts

This repository contains custom prompts for the bottle spinner game in the "The Goat House" VRChat world, created by lola18k. The prompts are stored in `prompts.txt` and can be loaded into the game via a hosted URL (e.g., using Dropbox, GitHub Gist, or Pastebin as per the asset documentation).

## Description

These prompts are designed for fun, interactive gameplay in VRChat's spin the bottle setup. They include a mix of dares, interactions, and silly actions to keep things engaging in a virtual environment. The file is formatted as a plain text (.txt) with each prompt on a new line.

Example prompts from `prompts.txt`:
- Kiss the player the bottle points to on the cheek.
- Hug the person to your right for 10 seconds.
- Share your most embarrassing VRChat story.
- And more...

## How to Use

1. Download or copy `prompts.txt`.
2. Upload it to a file hosting service (recommended: Dropbox for easy sharing).
3. Modify the share link to a direct download URL (e.g., replace `www.dropbox.com` with `dl.dropboxusercontent.com` and remove any `&dl=0` parameters).
4. In your VRChat world (using the VRCSKD3-WORLD and UdonSharp assets), paste the URL into the `promptsLoadUrl` field in the BottleSpinner component inside the SpinTheBottle object.
5. Load into the world to see the prompts in action.

For full setup instructions, refer to the asset documentation from the VRC Creator Companion.
